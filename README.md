- Both HTTP and HTTPS streams

## üìä Dashboard Features

### Stream Metrics Panel
- Real-time bitrate monitoring (video + audio)
- Segment success rate tracking
- Duration and timing analysis
- Resolution and codec information

### System Performance Panel (Cockpit.js)
- CPU usage gauges
- Memory utilization charts  
- Network bandwidth monitoring
- Disk usage indicators

### Visual Analytics

- Performance trend analysis
- Health status indicators
- Responsive design for all devices

## üèó Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **Flask Backend**: RESTful API for stream analysis and metrics
- **m3u8 Parser**: HLS playlist parsing and variant detection  
- **FFprobe Integration**: Media analysis and codec detection
- **Chart.js Frontend**: Real-time data visualization
- **Cockpit.js Metrics**: Advanced system monitoring dashboard

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/live-metrics/<playlist_url>` - Real-time stream metrics
- `GET /api/system-metrics` - System performance data
- `GET /api/health-check` - Application health status
- `GET /api/test-url/<playlist_url>` - URL connectivity testing

### Dependencies
- **Flask 2.3.3**: Web framework
- **m3u8 4.0.0**: HLS playlist parsing
- **requests 2.31.0**: HTTP client library
- **psutil** (optional): System metrics collection
- **FFmpeg/FFprobe**: Media analysis tools

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Setup
The application runs on `127.0.0.1:8181` by default. You can modify the host and port in `app.py`:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='127.0.0.1', port=8181, debug=True)
```

### FFmpeg Installation
For advanced video analysis, install FFmpeg:

**Windows**:
```bash
# Using Chocolatey
choco install ffmpeg

# Or download from: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
```

**macOS**:
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

**Linux**:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

### System Metrics (Optional)
Install psutil for real system monitoring:
```bash
pip install psutil
```

Without psutil, the application will use simulated metrics data.

## üö¶ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**FFprobe not found**:
- Ensure FFmpeg is installed and in your PATH
- The application will work without FFprobe but with limited analysis

**SSL Certificate errors**:
- The application handles SSL verification automatically
- HTTPS streams are supported with certificate validation disabled

**Memory usage**:
- Large playlists may consume more memory
- Consider segment limits for very long streams

**Port conflicts**:
- Change the port in `app.py` if 8181 is in use
- Ensure no firewall blocking on the chosen port

### Security Considerations

**Network Access**:
- Application binds to localhost (127.0.0.1) by default for security
- Only change host binding if you understand the security implications
- Consider using a reverse proxy (nginx) for external access

**Stream URL Validation**:
- Only analyze trusted HLS streams
- Be cautious with streams from unknown sources
- The application validates URLs but cannot guarantee stream content safety
